After you train a model, you can deploy it by using the {productname-short} model serving capabilities.

To prepare it for deployment, you must move the model from your workbench to your S3-compatible object storage. You use the data connection that you created in the xref:setup:running-a-script-to-install-storage.adoc[Storage Data Connections] section and upload the model from a notebook. You also convert the model to the portable ONNX format. ONNX allows you to transfer models between frameworks with minimal preparation and without the need for rewriting the models.

== Prerequisites

* You created the data connection `My Storage`.

== Procedure

. In your Jupyter environment, open the `2_save_model.ipynb` file.

. Follow the instructions in the notebook to make the model accessible in storage and save it in the portable ONNX format.

== Verification

When you have completed the notebook instructions, the `models/fraud/1/model.onnx` file is in your object storage and it is ready for your model server to use.
