== Introduction

Welcome!

In this {deliverable}, you will learn how to incorporate data science and artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) into an OpenShift development workflow.

You will use an example fraud detection model to complete the following tasks:

* Train a fraud detection model by using Jupyter Notebooks.
* Deploy the model by using {productname-short} single-model serving. (_new feature_)
* Refine and train the model by using automated pipelines. (_recently added feature_)

And you will do all of this without having to install anything on your own computer, thanks to https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-ai[{productname-long},window=_blank].

== About the example fraud detection model

The example fraud detection model monitors credit card transactions for potential fraudulent activity. It analyzes the following credit card transaction details:

* The geographical distance from the previous credit card transaction.
* The price of the current transaction, compared to the median price of all the userâ€™s transactions.
* Whether the user completed the transaction by using the hardware chip in the credit card,  entered a PIN number, or for an online purchase.

Based on this data, the model outputs the likelihood of the transaction being fraudulent.
