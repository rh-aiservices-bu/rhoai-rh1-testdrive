= Importing the {deliverable} files into the Jupyter environment

The Jupyter environment is a web-based environment, but everything you do inside it happens on *{productname-long}* and powered by the *OpenShift* cluster. This means that, without having to install and maintain anything on your own computer, and without disposing of lots of local resources like CPU, GPU and RAM, you can conduct your Data Science work in this powerful and stable managed environment.

== Prerequisite

You created a workbench, as described in xref:creating-a-workbench.adoc[Creating a workbench and selecting a Notebook image].


== Procedure

* Wait for your workbench to be fully started

. Click the *Open* link next to your workbench. If prompted, log in and allow the Notebook to authorize your user.
