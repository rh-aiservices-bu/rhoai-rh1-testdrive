= Testing the model API

Now that you've deployed the model, you can test its API endpoints.

=== Procedure

. In the Data Science dashboard, navigate to the project details page and scroll down to the *Models and model servers* section.

. Take note of the model's *Inference endpoint*.  You need this information when you test the model API.
