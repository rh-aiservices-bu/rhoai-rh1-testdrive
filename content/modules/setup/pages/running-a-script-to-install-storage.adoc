[id='running-a-script-to-install-storage_{context}']
= Running a script to install local object storage buckets and create data connections

For convenience, we are providing a script that will:

* create a minio instance in your project
* create 2 buckets in that minio instance
* generate a random user id and password for your minio instance
* create 2 Data Connections in your data science project
** one for each bucket
** both using the same credentials

This script is based on a quick tutorial for installing Minio (available https://ai-on-openshift.io/tools-and-applications/minio/minio/[here,window=_blank]).  +
In addition it will install some necessary network policies for service mesh functionality.

== Prerequisite

You must know the OpenShift resource name for your data science project so that you run the provided script in the correct project. +
To get the project's resource name:

* In the {productname-short} dashboard,
* select *Data Science Projects*
* click the *?* icon next to the project name
* A text box appears with information about the project, including its resource name:
