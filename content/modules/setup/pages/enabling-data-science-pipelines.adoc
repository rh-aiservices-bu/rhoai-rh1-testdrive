. Leave the database configuration as the default.

. Click *Configure*.

. Wait until the spinner disappears and *No pipelines yet* is displayed.

IMPORTANT: You need to **wait** until that screen is ready. If it's still spinning, wait for it to complete. If you continue and create your workbench **before** the pipeline server is ready, your workbench will not be able to submit pipelines to it.

== Verification

Check the *Pipelines* page. +
Pipelines are enabled when the *Pipeline server actions* option appears and the *Create pipeline server* button no longer appears.
